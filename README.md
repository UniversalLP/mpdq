Adding traybar icons to control mpd. To make this work with dwm install the [sytray patch](http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/systray).

Usage
```
chmod a+x ./mpdq
./mpdq
```
Requires mpd to be running and a playlist to be present.

Currently the config file allows you to change the following things
* Scaling of the tray icons
* Color of the tray icons
* Wether to display the current song in the dwm title bar (Title of the root window)
* Changing the update delay
